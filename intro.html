            I am a prisoner in the dungeon of the castle. My name is Zelda.
            <br>
            The wizard, Agahnim has seized control of the castle. He plans to unleash the Golden Power
            and spread darkness across the kingdom.
            <br>
            Only you can stop him Link. Find the Master Sword and save me.
            <br>
            I'm locked in the dungeon beneath the castle.
            <br>
            Please help me...
        </p>

            You awake suddenly, shooting up in your bed. You are alone.
            <br>
            You are shaken by the vivid dream that has woken you. You can still faintly hear that voice echoing in your head.
            <br>
            Who was this Zelda and what is the Master Sword?
            <br>
            A sudden sense of urgency grips you. You leap out of bed and through on your clothes as quiclky as possible. rummaging through your pockets you find two loose coins. You grab your uncles old sword and throw his hunting bow over your shoulder. You have to investigate the castle.
