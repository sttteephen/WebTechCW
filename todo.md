- delay arrow firing

- make moldrom hit box larger
- add fairy dialoug
- add fortune teller dialouge
- add old man dialouge after got the sword
- add win and lose screens
- boss fires something at link
- sword swipe action in game
- add sounds

TALKING POINTS:
- audio caused an issue were pages took ages to load
- by reloading the same page to add an item or dialouge to screen music can be interupted
should have used other options where dialouge is added to the same screen, would be better if 
i could update a specific part of the page
- apple doesn't do anything :\
- all images are loaded then removed depending on what the player has
- games are very similar and share functions but code is repeated in separate files
